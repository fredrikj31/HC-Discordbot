# Virtual Classroom

Virtual Classroom is a discord bot that runs discord.js.

I created the bot because my teachers needed a bot to make their life easier in the discord server.

## Installation
**1.** To get started you need to make a server via this server template: [Template here](https://discord.new/Aw9nWfkf9Pfq)

**2.** Then follow this link to invite the bot to your server.
[Click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694225044741816320&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847)

**3.** You will need to ensure that the bot is on top of the roles.

After you finish that step you are good to go.


## Not using the discord bot on the premade template

If you are not using the discord premade template I made for the discord bot, you will need to create some roles and channels for it to work.

#### Roles:
- Teacher
- Hand
- Student (Optional)

#### Channels:
- help
- A text channel that you can send your present check-in.
- A text channel where you want your hand message to be in.

## Errors/Help
If you encounter any errors or want help with the script, you can always submit an issue on the Github repository, and I will try to help as fast I can.
